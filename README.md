# Mission Control

A HBS BattleTech mod that varies the encounter specifics such as spawn locations, lance numbers and objectives

![Additional Lances](./docs/images/additional-lances.png)

## Features

### Additional Lances

Additional enemy and ally lances will spawn based on contact type, biome type, percentage chances, maximum limits and lance configs.

For full configuration options, see the [Additional Lances](./docs/additional-lances.md) page.

### Random Spawns

Depending on the contract type, the lance spawns will change every playthrough. The spawning uses contract type specific logic to suitably place the lances. There are no configuration options currently available for this as these come from the encounter type profiles that are created.

For full information on the random spawns, see the [Random Spawns](./docs/random-spawns.md) page.
